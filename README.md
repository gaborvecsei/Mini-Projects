MiniProjects is a collection of my scripts, little applications. I wrote these to learn languages and to create awesome projects.

### Mini Projects ###

I wanted to create scripts which are useful for others, that's why I used a lot of comments. I's like some kind of tutorial for students like me. Who like to test new things and don't want to get stuck with a good old ordinary language/project.
You can learn more about my computer science "philosophy" [on my blog](https://gaborvecsei.wordpress.com/)
So in this repository you can find projects from Matlab image segmentation to simple word counting, face detection and much more.
