The rosebush trembled when
    A bird on its twig flew;
My own soul trembles when
    I think, my dear, of you,
I think, my dear, of you,
    My darling, charming maid.
Thou art the richest gem
    My God has ever made.

When swollen is the Danube.
    Then it doth overflow:
My heart, with love replete,
    Doth now for thee just so.
Tell me, my dearest rose,
    Art thou to me still true?
Not even thy parents, dear,
    Can love thee as I do.

I know thy love was mine
    Neath last year’s summer sun;
But winter came since then — 
    Who knows what he has done?
Shouldst thou love me no more,
    I pray God bless thee still;
But, if thou lov’st me then.
    A thousandfold he will.
